ðŸ”§ Smart Home IoT System â€“ Python Simulation

This project is a Python-based simulation of a Smart Home IoT system that automates:

    ðŸŒ¡ Indoor climate control

     Motion-based camera privacy

     Smoke detection

     Live sensor visualization

     Manual device overrides

 Features

    Temperature & Humidity Monitoring
    Simulates sensors and maintains indoor comfort using a heater and window panels (replacing cooling fans).

    Motion Detection for Privacy
    Automatically turns off all indoor cameras and keeps only the door camera ON when motion is detected (i.e., resident is home).

    Smoke Detection Alert
    Triggers smoke alarm and pop-up warnings when smoke is detected.

    Manual Overrides
    GUI buttons allow users to toggle devices manually.

    Sensor Dashboard (Tkinter GUI)

        Visual LED indicators for sensor status

        Live plots of temperature and humidity trends

        Real-time logs of system actions
